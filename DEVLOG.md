# ✅ Daily Development Log

## 📅 Day 1 – May 6, 2025

* 🔤 **Full translation of the project to English**, including:

  * All `.py` file comments
  * CLI messages and prompts
  * Error messages and field names
* 📦 Renamed the project folder from `modern-phone-checker` to `modern_phone_checker` to enable proper `python -m` module execution
* 🧠 Fixed **relative import issues** and organized the module structure
* ✅ Successfully ran the following command:

  `bash
  python -m phone_checker check 612345678 --country 33
  `

  and confirmed visual output in the terminal
* 💾 Verified that the **smart caching system** works correctly
* 🧪 Performed end-to-end tests to ensure functionality remained intact after translation

At this point, the project is stable, modular, and running locally with full support for the 4 original platforms (WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram, Snapchat).
